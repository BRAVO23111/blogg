      Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander on Friday successfully
      underwent its first deboosting manoeuvre, said Indian Space Research
      Organisation (ISRO). The authorities asserted that the lander module's
      health was normal. "LM successfully underwent a deboosting operation
      that reduced its orbit to 113 km x 157 km," said ISRO in a X (formerly
      Twitter) post.
